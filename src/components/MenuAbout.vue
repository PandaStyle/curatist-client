        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
            We are a coder-designer couple who had a problem: the curious architect girl loved to see all the news but hated having to click around to countless websites; and the smart software guy knew there is a better way.
            <br/>   <br/>
            We looked around (the web), took the best practices and developed them to fit the unique world of architecture.<br/>   <br/>
            We created the Curatist to be smart, beautiful and useful.<br/>   <br/>
            It's a solution we love and hope youâ€™ll love it too.<br/>   <br/>
