                <p>
                    The Curatist payed a visit to the optometrist… and got a shiny new pair of glasses!
                    So what is new? Updated form and functions:
                    SmartSearch is here, and it will save time for you. A lot. [You can thank us later.] Inspiration tab got a whole new pool of amazing images. [Bye-bye extra time!]
                    And our core feature, Feed is constantly under development: while The Curatist is busy picking the best sources for you, there’s always time for a style-update: say hello to our new design! White is the new black and now you can choose from three layouts and two backgrounds to find your ultimate reading experience.
                    Can it get any better?
                    Yes! We put it all in the palm of your hand: download our brand new app from the Google Play Store! [sorry iPhones, you need to wait a little longer, but we’re on it]. Enjoy the mobile version wherever you are, but don’t forget the Curatist is still available as a Chrome extension and a regular website.
                    No matter which platform you choose, we hope you will enjoy browsing through the upgraded content and the polished design will please your eyes.
                    Happy curating!
